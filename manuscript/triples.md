# Triples

Triples are everywhere, albeit optimized into oblivion.

The major simplicity that I have known for years - and unable to express succinctly - is that compiler-people like triples.

I, also, call this *divide and conquer*[^t1].  

[^t1]: If you think of a better way to say that, let me know!
