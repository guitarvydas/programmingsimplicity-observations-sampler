# Triples

Triples are everywhere, albeit optimized into oblivion.

The major simplicity that I have known for years - and unable to express succinctly - is that compiler-people like triples.

I, also, call this *divide and conquer*[^t1].  

[^t1]: If you think of a better way to say that, let me know!

## XML

AFAIK, XML started out life as triples.  This doesn't mean that I am right, it is only what I believe.

Example of RDF triples:
