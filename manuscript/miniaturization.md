## Miniaturization (Super Advanced Programming)


Switches were miniaturized down to the size of dust particles.[^zephyris]

## Drawback - Dust
The main drawback of miniaturization is that dust particles interfere with and block operation of switches when switches are that small.

The solution to this problem is to use clean rooms.  Clean rooms keep dust out when making very small switches.[^duk]

## Drawback - \$\$\$
The drawback of using clean rooms and miniaturization is that they are very expensive.

Only a few startups could afford to pay for clean rooms, e.g. Motorola, Fairchild, National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, Mitel, etc.

You can build non-miniature transistors at home without needing a clean room.  Jeri Ellsworth shows how https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_znRopGtbE.  The catch is that you won't build 1,000s of big transistors this way and, therefore, won't benefit from the economies of scale.  A laptop computer these days has billions of transistors in it, and, it fits on your lap.  To build a laptop, you need to make lots of transistors that are very tiny.  And, you need to find a way to do this that makes the result affordable to regular people.
