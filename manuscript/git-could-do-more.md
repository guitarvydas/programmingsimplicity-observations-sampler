# Git Could Do More
## **Github, Git, Diff, etc.**

I consider "github" to be a whole gamut of technologies based on "diff".

-   githhub
    -   git
        -   diff (a UNIX tool)

"Github" is a production version of "diff".  

## **Automated DRY**

Github could use "diff" in a bigger way.  Instead of diff'ing lines of code, it should diff layers of design.  (Which might be blocks of code).

Our PLs[^pl] are just glorified text editors.


A lot of what we think about and build into PLs is DRY[^dry].

RY[^ry] is what we want, but we waste brain power on DRY.

Machines could detect DRY for us.  And refactor the code/design/etc. for us automagically.

Github could include technology to figure out DRY.

  

## **Git-based Editors**

Our editors could figure out repeated lumps of text and make a golden copy for us.

The editor could show repeated lumps of source in gray and automagically update the golden copy when we edit the gray parts.

[^pl]: PL means Programming Language
[^dry]: DRY means Don't Repeat Yourself
[^ry]: RY means Repeat Yourself
