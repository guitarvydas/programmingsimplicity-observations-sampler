# Programming Is Not Coding
## An Abbreviated History of Programming Languages.



The ground truth is *programming*, not *coding*.

The goal of programming is to control a machine.

A secondary goal of programming is to make it possible to change a program easily, or, to steal parts of a program and use them in other programs.

A tertiary goal of programming is to buff and polish specific notations, like textual programming languages.

Buffing and polishing code notations is a sub-goal of programming, and is, therefore, not as important as the main goal: controlling a machine. Coding - writing textual scripts in a programming language - is but a subset of the main goal.

## What is the point of programming?
To control a machine.

To accurately break down an action in steps so small that even a machine can perform the steps.

Current electronic machines provide us with a set of steps called "opcodes".

## Early Machines

Early machines were mechanical.

Early machines used gears and pulleys.
