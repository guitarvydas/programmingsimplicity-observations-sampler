# Programming Is Not Coding
## An Abbreviated History of Programming Languages.



The ground truth is *programming*, not *coding*.

The goal of programming is to control a machine.

A secondary goal of programming is to make it possible to change a program easily, or, to steal parts of a program and use them in other programs.

A tertiary goal of programming is to buff and polish specific notations, like textual programming languages.

Buffing and polishing code notations is a sub-goal of programming, and is, therefore, not as important as the main goal: controlling a machine. Coding - writing textual scripts in a programming language - is but a subset of the main goal.

## What is the point of programming?
To control a machine.

To accurately break down an action in steps so small that even a machine can perform the steps.

Current electronic machines provide us with a set of steps called "opcodes".

## Early Machines

Early machines were mechanical.

Early machines used gears and pulleys.

## High Level Electronic Machines

Electronic machines - called *computers* - are machines where the gears and pulleys are replaced by electronics.


## Early Programming of Computers


### Tools
The earliest tools for programming computers were soldering Irons.

### IDEs
The earliest IDEs - Integrated Development Environments - for programming computers were soldering stations which included a desk, a static mat, soldering iron, solder, resin and optionally, amenities like magnifying glasses, desk lamps, etc.

### Process
Changing a program, consisted of unsoldering wires and connecting them elsewhere.

### Drawbacks
The primitive programming tools and IDE were slow, but, orders of magnitude faster than changing the behaviour of machines by pulling gears and replacing them with other gears.

Other drawbacks included blisters on fingers.  Recently soldered nodes would remain hot for a while and would create blisters if touched too soon.
