    i actually just read this one as i was scanning: [https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/04/20/Git-Could-Do-More.html](https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/04/20/Git-Could-Do-More.html "https://guitarvydas.github.io/2021/04/20/Git-Could-Do-More.html")

    i love this so much haha. barring ideas of programming beyond text, this would be great

    at work, we have a practice: if we copy paste some significant code someplace, when it is not clear that a common function should be made, we leave a `COPYPASTA` comment referring to where it was copied from, and any thoughts about the copying. we have a script that greps for `TODO`, `FIXME`, etc.. and `COPYPASTA` and lists all of them with their line number it's great for rainy days, to analyze this report and do some compression ![:blobsmile:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/396521731440771085.webp?size=96&quality=lossless)
